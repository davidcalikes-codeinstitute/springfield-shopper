## Planning


## Features
I have implemented a long list of features, among them the following:

<!-- TOC --><a name="navigation"></a>
### Navigation

- __Target Audience__

    <img src="assets\images\readme_images\">
_Example of nav bar._

<br>
The website has appropriate and clear navigation features, reflecting its structured layout. Information and specific features are easy to find.
- A clear and intuitive **anchor menu** on the main homepage, allowing speedy access to the homepage's four main sections.
- A clear and uncluttered **site menu**, bringing the user to the child pages of the website.
- The site menu indicates to users which page they are currently on by underlining the appropriate text entry.
- a sticky **go-to-top button** on each page, so the user does not have to scroll back up manually.

The anchor menu on the left is less meaningful when the site is viewed on larger screens than on a mobile phone, but as the homepage develops over time, it will become more useful, even on larger screens.
